3.	Provide a cost-optimized and fastest solution to replicate the application deployed in step 2 in different region of AWS. 
-create a snapshot of the EC2 instance and then create the Image from snapshot


ec2 AMI snapshot --------
      Here's a summarized, step-by-step flow of the entire process:
Step 1: Create EC2 Instance
•	Login to AWS Console and go to EC2 Dashboard.
•	Click Launch Instances and configure:
o	Select AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).
o	Choose Instance Type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).
o	Configure storage, networking, and security settings.
•	Click Launch Instance and take a screenshot of the instance on your EC2 Dashboard for documentation.
Step 2: Create an AMI of the Running Instance
•	In the EC2 Dashboard, go to Instances and locate your instance.
•	Create an AMI:
o	Select the instance, click Actions > Create Image.
o	Enter a Name and Description for the AMI, then click Create Image.
•	AWS will create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that serves as a snapshot of this instance.
Step 3: Copy the AMI
•	In the EC2 Dashboard, navigate to Images > AMIs.
•	Locate your newly created AMI and select Actions > Copy AMI.
•	Choose the Region where you want the copied AMI to be stored and provide any additional details.
•	Click Copy AMI to create an identical AMI in the chosen region.
Step 4: Launch a New Instance from the Copied AMI
•	Still in the AMIs section, locate your copied AMI.
•	Select Launch Instance from Image:
o	Configure this instance’s settings as needed (e.g., instance type, storage).
•	Launch the Instance.
End Result:
You now have:
•	A new EC2 instance created from the initial configuration.
•	An AMI as a snapshot of the original instance.
•	A copy of the AMI in the desired region.
•	Another instance launched from this copied AMI.
This process allows you to replicate EC2 instances in other regions or for scaling purposes.
